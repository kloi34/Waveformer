# Waveformer
a jank program for Quaverers mapping in Quaver, the ultimate community-driven, open-source competitive rhythm game. gives text for timing points that you can copy-paste into .qua files. very useful for giving a general rough template for timing non-constant bpm and live songs. 

works best with music that has sharp, loud, and distinct sounds that are easy to spot in the waveform such as drums/percussion. fails miserably with smooth or quiet sounds/waveforms. also is not 100% accurate all the time.

use this more as a general guide to help time live music with loud/distinct drums knowing that you will still have to go through adding/removing/adjusting a lot of timing points, but also knowing that a large chunk of the tedious work has been done by this program

## Todo
- maybe improve the beat detection algorithm
- add UI
- refactor code
