# Waveformer
a jank program for Quaverers mapping in Quaver, the ultimate community-driven, open-source competitive rhythm game. gives text for timing points that you can copy-paste into .qua files. very useful for giving a general rough template for timing non-constant bpm and live songs. probably works best with music that has sharp, non-blending sounds such as drums/percussion.

## Todo
- make the program work in-browser (for everyone that isn't just using vscode and live server)
