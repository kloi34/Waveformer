# Waveformer
a jank program for Quaverers mapping in Quaver, the ultimate community-driven, open-source competitive rhythm game. gives text for timing points that you can copy-paste into .qua files. very useful for giving a general rough template for timing non-constant bpm and live songs. works best with music that has sharp, non-blending sounds that are easy to spot in the waveform such as drums/percussion. fails miserably with smooth sounds/waveforms.

## Todo
- maybe improve the beat detection algorithm
- add UI
- refactor code
